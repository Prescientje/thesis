My ICS Thesis, entitled "Identifying Hand Hygiene Using Neural Networks".

This project used acceleration data from several healthcare workers recorded on custom wrist sensors in order to classify novel samples as either "Hand Hygiene" or "Not Hand Hygiene." Deep neural networks designed with Tensorflow were developed in order to produce a classification system.

The code can be found in the [code directory](https://github.com/Prescientje/thesis/tree/master/code).
